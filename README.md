ü™® Earthquake Visualizer

A React-based global earthquake dashboard built using live USGS GeoJSON feeds.

üåç Overview

The Earthquake Visualizer displays real-time earthquake data on an interactive map. It uses the USGS Earthquake GeoJSON API to show magnitude, time, and location of quakes. Users can filter by minimum magnitude and explore details via map markers.

This project was developed as part of a Full Stack Assessment Challenge, focusing on clean React architecture, accessibility, and data visualization.
